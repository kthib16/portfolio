### Explanation

BlocJams is a music player application I designed and redesigned as part of frontend course with Bloc. I initially designed the site using JQuery and later redesigned it with AngularJS to learn another framework.

### Problem

The site needed to be responsive on multiple different devices. The site also needed to be able to play music while updating a display with the information for the current song.

### Solution

Using Angular and java, I was able to write code that update the HTML for each song as users clicked on the navigation buttons, regardless of their device.

### Conclusion

This project was an introduction to a lot of new code for me. I found Angular and JQuery to be extremely easy to navigate and use in building websites.
