In my day-to-day life, I work in communications where  I regularly deal with data visualization projects (whether it's overseeing the projects or working on them myself) as well as working with Wordpress to upload content, including making decisions on how that content is presented. So it seemed to me only natural to advance my career by learning web design -- either in greater depth (HTML/CSS) or something entirely new(Java/frameworks such as Angular).

Now I feel like I'm sort of behind the times. These days it seems like everyone has at least minimal experience with some sort of code and can at the very least *italicize* words. In fact, I was formerly a journalist and some of my first real experience with creative web design (and when I grew really fascinated with it) was when that industry started to migrate toward a digital-first mindset.

So it seems very overdue that I would learn these skills, and it's something I've been meaning to pick up for a long time (much like my actual graphic design experience, which I sort of learned to master as I went along).

There's a lot of overlap between my graphic design process (and even my writing process) and my approach to web design. As a journalist, I'd also have to take complex language and industry jargon, decipher it and turn it into something easy to read and understand for the layman.

As a designer working with a bunch of economists, it can sometimes be difficult to distill a bunch of complex ideas into a simple, easy-to-read chart or infographic, but with the proliferation of social media, it's important to understand that once something is on the web, anyone can find it. So that means the information presented must be accessible as possible. 

To that extent in web design, it's not just about what looks the *coolest*, but what's the best way to present information. It's all about the user and making their experience as easy as possible.
