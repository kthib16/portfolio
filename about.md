I'm a digital content specialist with a knack for data visualization and an interest in trying new ways to present information. I originally worked as a journalist, writing about everything from local politics to human interest stories, before turning my attention to graphic design. Now I'm trying my hand at web design to make the graphics I love to create more interactive.
